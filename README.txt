Talentify was created, coded, and designed by CS50xMiami students, Romi Goldzweig and Natalie Perez

The purpose of Talentify is for people to post services they offer and connect with others who are offering services.

In order to search or post a service, you must register or log into the site. You may post multiple services. to see all the services you have posted, visit the "My Services" page. You may also delete any services you no longer wish to offer.

To search for a service you can search any combination of city, state, and/or service type. Once you find the service you are interested in, you can select the contact button to get the vendor's contact information and also see the other services they offer.
